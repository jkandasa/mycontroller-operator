# mycontroller-operator
MyController operator is used to deploy and manage [MyController](https://v2.mycontroller.org/) server in Kubernetes/OpenShift environment.

## Getting Started
Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### Running on the cluster
1. Install Instances of MyController server:

```sh
# basic install
kubectl create -f config/samples/v1-basic-install.yaml

# with storage
kubectl create -f config/samples/v1-with-storage.yaml
```

2. Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:
	
```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/mycontroller-operator:tag
```
	
3. Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/mycontroller-operator:tag
```

### Uninstall CRDs
To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

### Undeploy controller
UnDeploy the controller to the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```

## Deploy in OpenShift
#### Catalog Source (mycontroller-catalog-source.yaml)
```yaml
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: CatalogSource
metadata:
  name: mycontroller-cs
  namespace: openshift-marketplace
spec:
  displayName: MyController Catalog
  image: quay.io/mycontroller/mycontroller-operator-catalog:v1.0.0
  sourceType: grpc
```

#### Subscription (mycontroller-subscription.yaml)
```yaml
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: Subscription
metadata:
  name: mycontroller-operator
  namespace: openshift-operators
spec:
  channel: alpha
  installPlanApproval: Automatic
  name: mycontroller-operator
  source: mycontroller-cs
  sourceNamespace: openshift-marketplace
```
```bash
oc create -f mycontroller-catlog-source.yaml
oc create -f mycontroller-subscription.yaml
```

## Contributing
### How it works
This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/)

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/) 
which provides a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources untile the desired state is reached on the cluster 

### Test It Out
1. Install the CRDs into the cluster:

```sh
make install
```

2. Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):

```sh
make run
```

**NOTE:** You can also run this in one step by running: `make install run`

### Modifying the API definitions
If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets
